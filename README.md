# Synonyms

The project aims to develop a mobile application that functions as a synonym search tool, using the MVVM design pattern and written in Swift. The application should allow users to search for synonyms for a word in both directions, with multiple synonyms returned upon request. It should also implement the transitive rule, where a synonym of a synonym is also considered a synonym.
